Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, or Tyrion Lannister? Who is the most important character in Game of Thrones? Let's see what mathematics can tell us about this!

In this project, you will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). You will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.

This project assumes you are familiar with the networkx package and different network centrality measures. It also assumes that you have used pandas and can manipulate DataFrames. 

This project is based on DataCamp's project '[A Network Analysis of Game of Thrones](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/76)' and uses a dataset parsed by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan which is available [here](https://github.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf).
