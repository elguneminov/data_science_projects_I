# data_science_projects
A collection of my data science projects from various datasets, case studies, and real-world problems that include/cover these topics:

- Importing and cleaning data
- Data manipulation
- Data visualization
- Probability & statistics
- Exploratory data analysis
- Machine learning
- Applied finance

These projects are mostly written in Python programming language and using Jupyter Notebook as the IDE (I might start using other programming such as R or other IDEs in the future as I continue to build this repository). A lot of these projects are sourced from DataCamp, Kaggle, Dataquest and various blogs on the internet that I find interesting to work on. Thanks for checking it out!
