The data were obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students. We will use it to do some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to predict students final grade.

What we want to know:

Correlation between features
Weekly consumption of alcohol by the students
Final exam scores based on student's alcohol consumption

The datasets is from [UCI Machine Learning's Student Alcohol Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption), a social, gender and study data from secondary school students.
