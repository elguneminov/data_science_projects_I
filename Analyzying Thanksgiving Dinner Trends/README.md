We'll look into a dataset on what Americans typically eat for Thanksgiving dinner in 2015 as we explore the pandas library. It contains 1058 online survey responses collected by [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-your-part-of-america-eats-on-thanksgiving/). Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location. This dataset will allow us to discover regional and income-based patterns in what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. As we explore the data and try to find patterns, weâ€™ll be heavily using the grouping and aggregation functionality of pandas. 

Based on a tutorial from [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandas-tutorial-python-2/) and you can download the original dataset [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015). Thanks!
