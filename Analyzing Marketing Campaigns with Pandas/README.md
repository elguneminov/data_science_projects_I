This project is based on DataCamp's [Analyzing Marketing Campaign with Pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-marketing-campaigns-with-pandas). We will look into translating common business questions into measurable outcomes, including "How did this campaign perform?", "Which channel is referring the most subscribers?", "Why is a particular channel underperforming?" and more using a fake marketing dataset based on the data of an online subscription business. This project is utilizing Python and pandas fundamentals, such as merging/slicing datasets, groupby(), correcting data types and visualizing results using matplotlib. There are four parts of this project that will be covered:
- Pandas
- Exploratory Analysis & Summary Statistics
- Conversion Attribution
- Personalization A/B Test

Thank you!
